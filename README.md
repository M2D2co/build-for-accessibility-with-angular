# BuildForAccessibilityWithAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and includes Angular Material. Styles use Sass (scss syntax).

The project has 2 main branches:

* `main`: WCAG compliant version of the application
* `start`: Purposely non compliant version used to teach the "Accessibility in Angular" workshop.

**If you are attending the worshop please [follow the setup instructions](https://github.com/M2D2co/build-for-accessibility-with-angular/blob/main/requirements.md) ahead of time. Thank you.**

A demo of the compliant site can be found at https://m2d2co.github.io/build-for-accessibility-with-angular/


## Development server
